A personal assistant to help plan and reflect on your goals for the day.

## Why Use Stewie?
There are numerous [studies](http://corwin-connect.com/2017/02/help-students-reflect-set-goals-powerful-learning/) that support the setting and reflecting of goals as crucial to personal growth.

Most know these two things are important, but they are still often neglected as we hurry to class/work in the early morning and sleep after working deep into the night day-after-day.

Stewie is a personal assistant that you can text in the morning to set goals while using in the bathroom ðŸš½, taking a shower (if your phone is waterproof, of course ðŸ’¦), or during your morning commute ðŸš‰. You can update which goals you've completed through the day by texting Stewie. All of your goals and their completion status are stored onto a dashboard. View it to quickly understand what goals you're completing and which ones you aren't.


## Next Steps
We're currently working on:
- Analytics
- Option to have Stewie phone you and ask a few reflective questions each night at a selected time
